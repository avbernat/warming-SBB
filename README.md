Extreme climate events are predicted to increase in the future, which will have significant evolutionary consequences on insects. Here, I will conduct an independent project on the direct and indirect effects of extreme hot temperatures and extreme variable temperatures on the growth of Jadera haematoloma, the soapberry bug. This research will better explain possible drivers of changing soapberry bug phenology and/or morphology, and it will explore the factors that determine the sensitivity or resilience of soapberry bugs to climate extremes on the individual and population level.
